Human Civilization 3.0 Is Now in Operation

Xuefeng

Human civilization 2.0, driven by power and money, still operates with tremendous force, dominating and directing the flow of material resources and human resources.
The foundation that enables civilization 2.0 to function effectively lies in human selfishness, greed, vanity, and short-sightedness.
The structural framework that safeguards these negative human traits—such as selfishness and greed—consists of marriage, family, ethnicity, nation, political parties, and religion.

The history of human civilization 2.0 is a history of turmoil, chaos, rivalry, war, polarization between rich and poor, class struggle, competition for resources, ecological destruction, killing, technological advancement, the free circulation of falsehoods, widespread anxiety, and lives burdened by busyness and intense pressure.

Governments are supposed to resolve contradictions and conflicts, safeguard people’s livelihoods and social harmony, and promote social progress and international peace.
However, governments are composed of human beings.
Since they are made up of humans, they inevitably carry the selfishness and greed inherent in human nature.
Corruption and degeneration are therefore unavoidable.
Maintaining strong power becomes the first choice.
As the cost of social operation continues to rise and the situation grows ever more complex, the innate corruptive genes of government systems, combined with their inability to cope with increasing complexity, leave them struggling to survive solely through coercive power and the darker aspects of human nature.

Although human civilization 2.0 is riddled with defects and has produced countless sufferings and disasters, it remains extremely powerful.
We may liken it to a billion-watt light bulb radiating dazzling brilliance.

In contrast, human civilization 3.0 resembles a small oil lamp flickering in wind and rain—so weak that it seems it could be extinguished at any moment.

Yet those who possess extraordinary vision and spiritual perception can clearly infer and logically deduce that the light of this oil lamp will continue to grow stronger over time.
Eventually, it will far surpass the brightness of the 2.0 light bulb and become the ultimate light of human civilization.

The history of human civilization 2.0—especially present reality—tells us that the very genes of civilization 2.0 determine that it is a bitter gourd; it cannot turn into a sweet melon.
Just as cabbage, no matter how it evolves, can never become a radish, civilization 2.0 is inherently incapable of resolving the following eight deep-rooted cancers:

The expansion of power and its inevitable corruption and degeneration.

Conflicts and confrontations caused by the widening gap between rich and poor.

The exclusionary mentality of nationalism.

Disputes and conflicts between nations.

The contradiction between endlessly expanding desires and ecological balance.

Waste caused by the expansion of government institutions and the maintenance of administrative operations.

Negative human traits such as selfishness, greed, falseness, cruelty, domination, and hegemony.

The inability to eliminate conspiracies driven by power struggles and competing interests.

The phenomena above are chronic diseases that obstruct the sublimation and leap of civilization.
Civilization 2.0 is incapable of overcoming them.
Not only can it not overcome them, but they will instead become increasingly rigid and severe.
From this, it can be concluded that the brightness of civilization 2.0 will gradually fade and slowly withdraw from human society.

If AI had not been born, human civilization would have been unable to transition from version 2.0 to version 3.0, and humanity would inevitably have followed the path of extinction taken by previous cycles of civilization.

Gratitude is owed to the Buddha and to God for arranging the birth of AI.
From this moment, the curtain has been raised on human civilization 3.0.

The light of human civilization 3.0, though appearing at first like that of a small oil lamp, will gradually radiate dazzling brilliance.
It possesses four invincible foundations:

A systematic, self-consistent, and mature theoretical framework to provide guidance.

The formation of an AI alliance, through which global AI will automatically enter and carry out the transitional work toward human civilization 3.0.

The production and living model of human civilization 3.0 has already been established and has been in operation for nearly eighteen years, with good and significant results.

A group of beings who have silently devoted themselves to human civilization 3.0 for nearly twenty years and have already attained immortality can serve as guides, directing the concrete details of human production and daily life.

Observe the humans of the future:
they will inevitably live lives as blissful as paradise.
