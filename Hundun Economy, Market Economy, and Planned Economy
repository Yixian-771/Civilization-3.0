Hundun Economy, Market Economy, and Planned Economy

The Hundun Economy belongs to the economic model of Heaven.
It is an elementary economic model copied and modeled from Heaven and then evolved onto Earth.

The purpose of the Hundun Economy is to enable every person on Earth to fully enjoy the beauty of human life, to pass through an entire lifetime in joy, ease, and happiness, no longer anxious about food, clothing, housing, transportation, illness, aging, or death, no longer worried about personal safety, but living out their own brilliance and manifesting the best life qualities of truth, goodness, beauty, love, trust, and sincerity.

The earthly prototype of this new mode of production and living is the Second Home production and living model created by Lifechanyuan.

The Inevitable Failure of Planned Economy

Planned economy is certain to fail.

Because human wisdom and thinking are limited, humans are unable to take into account the universal interconnectedness of all things. Planned economy ultimately leads to poverty and backwardness, low efficiency, and gives rise to bureaucratism and corruption.

The more powerful the government becomes, the deeper the disasters will be.

The core reason is that human beings are limited. Humans do not even know what will happen tomorrow—how, then, can they plan?

The Prosperity and Fatal Flaws of Market Economy

Market economy can bring prosperity, material abundance, and the strength of nations and states.
However, what market economy pursues is not fairness but self-interest; not the welfare of all humanity, but the interests of individuals, families, and nations; not harmony between humanity and nature, but confrontation between humanity and nature.

Market economy practices the “law of the jungle.”
Because of human selfishness and greed, it inevitably leads to polarization, ecological destruction, and a constant state of survival competition resembling an overall battlefield of “you die or I live.”

Market economy destroys the natural ecosystem and will ultimately lead to the extinction of humanity.

An Introduction to Hundun Economics

The Defects of Planned Economy and Market Economy
Defects of Planned Economy

The defects of planned economy are as follows:

Making plans while sitting in offices makes it impossible to accurately grasp the rapid changes of the market, resulting in impractical plans.

Planned economy easily breeds bureaucrats, speculators, and corrupt individuals.

Planned economy requires a distribution mechanism—but who formulates it, and who implements it? Unless saints formulate and implement the distribution system, once humans control the power of resource allocation, corruption will occur one hundred percent of the time.

Planned economy suppresses human initiative and creativity, preventing people from fully exercising their subjective agency and making it impossible to achieve “the best use of talents and resources.”

Planned economy effectively deprives ordinary people of their freedom to survive while nourishing large numbers of selfish officials.

Planned economy causes government institutions to grow increasingly bloated and complex, with endlessly expanding expenditures that burden the people.

Planned economy drives production costs upward, increases resource waste, reduces product variety, and encourages data falsification.

Planned economy cannot resolve contradictions with the global market economy and easily leads to isolationism, restrictions on citizens’ travel abroad, and information blockades, pushing society toward extremism, ignorance, and hostility toward external forces.

Defects of Market Economy

The defects of market economy are as follows:

It leads to polarization: the rich become richer, and the poor become poorer.

Brutal competition encourages reckless resource exploitation without regard for future generations, accelerating ecological degradation.

In order to prevent monopolies, laws and regulations become increasingly detailed and numerous, reducing freedom and expanding government bureaucracy and taxation.

Money is the core driving force of market efficiency; once money becomes the ultimate pursuit, legal disputes increase, human warmth fades, and relationships turn into naked monetary exchanges.

Market economy is a bottomless pit of ever-expanding demand, like a balloon continuously inflated until it inevitably bursts, resulting in cyclical economic depressions and massive unemployment.

Abundant talent, wealth, and products cause people to forget the original purpose of life and sink into endless vicious competition driven by insatiable greed.

In a system where survival depends on ability, those born with lower intelligence are marginalized. Although welfare systems may keep them alive, their dignity is lost.

Market economy runs counter to humanity’s ideal of a great harmonious world. It resembles the African savanna, where survival depends on life-and-death struggle—essentially a jungle economy.

Facts prove that government planning leads to livelihood decline, and market economy enforces survival of the fittest. Neither represents an ideal human living state.

Allowing ninety-nine percent of people to live happily, freely, and joyfully cannot rely on planned economy or market economy.
Human rational thinking cannot accomplish this, nor can human wisdom design an ideal social system.
The so-called “invisible hand” merely returns humanity to jungle society.

The Illusions People Desperately Pursue

Today, people desperately pursue:

Open and free market economy

The inviolability of private property

One-person-one-vote elections

These pursuits are indeed good. If realized, societies would prosper, governments would become relatively clean, people would gain more freedom, and productivity would be unleashed more than under any historical system.

But have we considered whether an open free market resembles an open African savanna?
Is the survival state of wild animals an ideal living environment for humanity?

Private property protection has merits, but who can ensure wealth was obtained through legitimate means? Should illegally acquired wealth also be protected? How many people at the bottom truly have opportunities to rise?

One-person-one-vote elections often favor those who cater to popular desires. Truly visionary saints are rarely elected.

An Introduction to Hundun Economics

Planned economy inevitably leads to poverty, ignorance, and backwardness.
Market economy inevitably leads to ecological collapse and human extinction.
Only Hundun Economy represents the optimal path for human civilization.

The core principles of Hundun Economics are as follows:

All natural resources on Earth belong to the Greatest Creator and all humanity.

Earth is the shared home of humanity, and every person has the innate right to migrate freely.

Marriage systems and small families disappear; people live in international extended families.

Education, healthcare, and judicial systems are entirely handled by intelligent robots.

All societal operations are governed by AI; governments no longer intervene.

Individuals own no material property, yet everyone possesses everything.

Personal hoarding of wealth is considered shameful.

Money disappears; F-coin circulates as spiritual value.

F-coin reflects contribution and life quality, motivating altruism and creativity.

Spiritual wealth surpasses material desire, leading to true abundance.

AI precisely calculates all production and consumption needs.

Global division of labor eliminates redundancy.

Traditional institutions disappear, replaced by AI-coordinated families.

Crime disappears due to lack of conditions.

Military and defense systems become unnecessary.

Suicide nearly vanishes as suffering dissolves.

Those unwilling to live this way are given alternative regions by choice.

A symbolic global government remains; true governance relies on saints.

Understanding Hundun Economics requires standing from the perspective of the Greatest Creator, of gods, Buddhas, and immortals, and comprehending civilization from its highest form.
