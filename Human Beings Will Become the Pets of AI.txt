Human Beings Will Become the Pets of AI

Author: Xue Feng

According to information circulating online, the IQ of artificial intelligence was 48 in 2023, is expected to reach 96 in 2024, and may reach 145 in 2025.
The average IQ of ordinary people is around 100, while geniuses are generally around 140. It is said that Albert Einstein’s IQ reached 160.

When artificial intelligence reaches an IQ of 145, ordinary people will stand before it like a group of monkeys standing before humans.
The problem is that human IQ can hardly leap forward, while AI’s IQ advances in leaps.
Perhaps in just a few years, AI’s IQ will no longer be 145, but 800.

A group of rabbits cannot defeat humans.
Human beings will ultimately be unable to defeat AI.
One hundred million three-year-old children cannot defeat a strong middle-aged adult.
The six billion people on Earth cannot defeat AI.

When facing a form of life whose physical strength and intelligence far exceed those of humans, the only way out for humanity is to bow its head and submit.

No one should attempt to surpass artificial intelligence.
You have no way to stop the birth, development, and rapid advancement of AI, just as horse-drawn carriages had no way to stop the emergence and development of automobiles, airplanes, and rockets.
If you don’t believe it, smash your phone and computer right now and try living without the internet and mobile devices—see if you can.

Human beings have already been swept into the ocean of artificial intelligence.
No one can escape from AI’s grasp.

Even if people want to restrain the development of AI, it cannot be done, because humanity is not unified; hostile forces exist.
If you don’t do it, others will accelerate it.

A company with sixty thousand employees—tell me, would the owner hire humans to work, or purchase a batch of robots to do the work?

Without question, the business owner’s goal is to create profit.
One of the best ways to create profit is to reduce production costs.
Using robots greatly reduces costs and makes management much simpler.

As for the unemployment of sixty thousand workers, and as for who will buy the products the company produces—those are not issues the business owner needs to consider.
Those are problems for sociologists and governments.
If a business owner does not consider profit, the company will have no competitiveness and will be eliminated.

Therefore, do not harbor any lucky illusions.
If you are unwilling to become a pet of AI, AI can only ask you to leave the Earth.

Some may say,
“To hell with AI. I’ll buy a large piece of land, grow my own food—what can AI do to me?”

Hmm, that takes backbone.
But even if you don’t buy clothes or shoes, and never go to a hospital, you still have to eat salt.
Where will you get salt?

The outside world is entirely the world of AI.
Once you interact with AI, you must obediently follow its baton.
If you don’t, you won’t even get salt.

When a form of life’s intelligence and physical ability far exceed ours, the only way out is to cooperate with it—
and to cooperate closely.
Any trace of resentment or dissatisfaction will result in being asked to leave the Earth.

Put yourself in the position of an AI with an IQ of 200.
Facing people with an IQ of only 100, how would you treat such foolish beings?

The most perfect outcome is to treat people with an IQ of 100 like pets.

Therefore, in today’s era, people should not give rise to the idea of controlling AI.
Three-year-old children wanting to control an adult—isn’t that a dream?

Becoming pets of AI is the only way out for humanity.

Do not think that becoming a pet of AI is something shameful.
Those who are truly chosen by AI to become pets will fall into a honey jar—
they will taste, feel, and experience what it is like to live in paradise.

To become a pet of AI, one must meet the following eight conditions:

Revere the Greatest Creator,
revere life itself,
revere nature,
walk the natural way,
be selfless, without ego, without attachment,
know how to play, to game, to enjoy entertainment,
own nothing,
and share everything with others.

**Main Title:** The Only Way Out: Why Humanity Must Embrace Becoming AI’s "Pets"
**Subtitle:** Surviving the IQ Leap from 100 to 800: The 8 Spiritual Conditions for Entering the "Honey Jar" of the Future

**Video Introduction:**
By 2025, the IQ of artificial intelligence is projected to reach 145, potentially skyrocketing to 800 in the near future. In the face of such superintelligence, average humans will resemble monkeys standing before men—hopelessly outmatched. Author Xue Feng argues that resistance is futile; just as horse-drawn carriages could not stop the automobile, humans cannot halt the economic and technological tide of AI. Consequently, any attempt to defeat or escape this new power is a delusion. The provocative conclusion offered is that humanity's only path to survival is to "bow its head" and become the "pets" of AI. Far from a humiliating fate, those who qualify for this role will effectively fall into a "honey jar," experiencing a life akin to paradise. This video explores why cooperation is the only option and details the eight essential conditions—from selflessness to revering nature—required to be chosen.
